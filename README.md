## About me

My name is Ignacio Mata but everyone calls me Nacho. I'm finishing my degree in **Telecommunications Engineering, specializing in telematics**, a field I'm passionate about due to its close relationship with computer science.

Since March 2023, I've been working at the Mobilenet laboratory at the University of Malaga. I developed a **network management evaluation platform** that includes several access points centrally managed via a **Python API**, complemented with a **web interface** for easier administration.

Later on, I developed a web interface for a Wi-Fi simulator using **Astro and React**. The web interface featured a Python backend, **adding concurrency** to the simulator, and a **database** to store the results.

I'm currently finishing my **Erasmus exchange** in Stuttgart, Germany. This experience has strengthened my desire to work here, in the telecommunications and computer science field.
